The video discusses strategies for responsible system usage and content moderation. It introduces OpenAI's moderation API, which helps developers ensure compliance with usage policies and filter out harmful content in various categories. The API classifies content and provides subcategory details for precise moderation. It also offers flexibility to set custom policies for category scores. The video demonstrates the usage of the moderation API through examples and showcases the importance of detecting and preventing prompt injections, where users manipulate the system's intended instructions or constraints. Two strategies are presented: using delimiters and clear instructions in system messages, and incorporating an additional prompt to identify prompt injections. Examples illustrate how these strategies can help avoid prompt injections. The video concludes by mentioning upcoming sections on input processing techniques.
