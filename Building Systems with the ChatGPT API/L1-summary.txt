In this first video, I will provide you with an overview of how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT work. I'll explain the training process, the role of the tokenizer, and how it impacts LLM outputs. Additionally, we'll explore the chat format for LLMs, which allows for system and user message specification. I'll guide you through the training of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, and how reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) enhances the quality of their outputs. Finally, I'll discuss tokenization, input/output limits, and share tips on securely using the OpenAI API. It's important to recognize the transformative potential of prompting in AI application development. Instead of spending months on data collection, model training, and deployment, prompting with LLMs streamlines the process and empowers developers to achieve faster results.
