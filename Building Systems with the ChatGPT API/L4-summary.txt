The speaker discusses the concept of chain of thought reasoning, where models are instructed to reason about a problem in steps. They introduce the idea of inner monologue, which involves hiding parts of the model's reasoning from the user. An example is provided where the model is instructed to follow a series of steps to answer customer queries about specific products. The steps include identifying if the user is asking about specific products, checking if the products are in a given list, listing any assumptions made by the user, determining the truth of those assumptions based on product information, and politely correcting any incorrect assumptions. The speaker demonstrates how the model can handle user queries and provide appropriate responses based on the instructions given. They also mention that prompt complexity should be optimized through experimentation and that complex tasks can be broken down into simpler subtasks for better handling.
