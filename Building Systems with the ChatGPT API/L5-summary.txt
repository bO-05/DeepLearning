The speaker discusses the strategy of splitting complex tasks into simpler subtasks by chaining multiple prompts together. They provide analogies to explain the benefits of this approach, such as cooking a complex meal in stages or reading modular code versus spaghetti code. Chaining prompts helps manage complexity, reduce errors, lower costs, and allows for the use of external tools. The speaker demonstrates an example of using multiple prompts to answer a customer's question about products. They also introduce helper functions to look up product information and generate output strings. By providing relevant context to the model, the speaker shows how breaking down the task into subtasks improves the model's ability to answer questions effectively.
