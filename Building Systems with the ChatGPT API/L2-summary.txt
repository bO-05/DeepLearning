This part discusses the evaluation of inputs to ensure the quality and safety of a system, particularly in tasks where different instructions are required for handling various cases. The approach suggested is to classify queries into primary and secondary categories, allowing for the selection of appropriate instructions. For example, in a customer service assistant, different instructions may be necessary when a user wants to close their account compared to when they inquire about a specific product. This part provides an example using delimiters to separate system messages and user queries, and it demonstrates how the model can classify queries into primary and secondary categories. The output is structured in JSON format for easy processing, and it highlights the importance of providing specific instructions based on query categorization.
